# ModelSpec

A Rust compiler and runtime for `.mspec` tensor-program specifications. Humans start at
[README.md](README.md); the design is [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## State

Design only (DESIGN.md revision 0.1, 2026-10-21). No Cargo workspace, no code, no CI. The first
implementation work is milestone M0 (DESIGN.md § 1 and § 11, iteration 1).

## Rules

- DESIGN.md is the authority. A change to semantics, IR levels, the operator registry or an ADR in
  DESIGN.md § 12 is a design change: edit DESIGN.md in the same change and bump its revision line.
- Keep the seven invariants in DESIGN.md § 0. A change that breaks one is refused, not worked around.
- `modelspec-core` must build and test without Vulkan installed. Vulkan code sits behind the
  `vulkan` Cargo feature (DESIGN.md § 7).
- No Python, PyTorch, CUDA API or CUDA toolkit dependency, in code, tests or tooling.
- Correctness before speed: the CPU oracle and finite-difference gradient checks (DESIGN.md § 9,
  gates 1–3) exist before any GPU kernel is optimized.
- The files in `examples/` are target syntax. Keep them in step with DESIGN.md § 2 until a parser
  can check them, then make `modelspec check` on every example part of the gate.
- Use `Taskfile.yml` (go-task) for build and test entry points once code exists; not a Makefile.
